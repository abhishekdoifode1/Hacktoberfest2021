/**
 * Finds prime factors of a number.
 *Prime factors are those prime numbers which multiply together to give the original number.
 * For example 39 will have prime factors of 3 and 13 which are also prime numbers. 
 * Another example is 15 whose prime factors are 3 and 5.
 * @param {number} n - the number that is going to be split into prime factors.
 * @returns {number[]} - array of prime factors.
