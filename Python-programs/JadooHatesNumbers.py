# Jadoo hates numbers, but he requires to print a special number "420" to recharge the equation of life. He asks your help to print the number but Since he hates numbers, he asks you to write the program such that there would not be any number in the code.


# Write your code here
print(ord('F')+ord('F')+ord('F')+ord('F')+ord('F')+ord('F'))

# F -> 70 * 6 = 420
