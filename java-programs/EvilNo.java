/*The Evil number is another special positive whole number in Java that has an even number of 1's in its binary equivalent. Unlike Prime and Armstrong numbers, Evil number is not so popular and asked by the interviewers.

The numbers which are not evil are called odious numbers. Let's some examples of evil and odious numbers.

15 is an evil number because in its binary equivalent, i.e., 1111, it has an even number of ones.
16 is an odious number because in its binary equivalent, i.e., 10000 has not even number of ones
23 is also an evil number because it has an even number of ones in its binary equivalent, i.e., 10111.*/
