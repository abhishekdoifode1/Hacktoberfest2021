## Day 3. Two City Scheduling

There are 2N people a company is planning to interview. 
The cost of flying the i-th person to city A is costs[i][0], and the cost of flying the i-th person to city B is costs[i][1].

Return the minimum cost to fly every person to a city such that exactly N people arrive in each city.

Example 1:

Input: [[10,20],[30,200],[400,50],[30,20]]

Output: 110

Explanation:

The first person goes to city A for a cost of 10.
The second person goes to city A for a cost of 30.
The third person goes to city B for a cost of 50.
The fourth person goes to city B for a cost of 20.

The total minimum cost is 10 + 30 + 50 + 20 = 110 to have half the people interviewing in each city.

Note:

1. 1 <= costs.length <= 100
2. It is guaranteed that costs.length is even.
3. 1 <= costs[i][0], costs[i][1] <= 1000
